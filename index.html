			<p>The powerful strikes of peacock mantis shrimp are powered by elastic forces, meaning that the farther back they pull their raptorial appendages, the stronger the strike. Speeds of up to 20 m/s have been recorded for a strike. Each strike actually generates two blows, one from the impact of the limb itself (400-1501 Newtons) and one from the explosion of a cavitation bubble created from the initial impact (up to 504 Newtons). When kept in aquariums, these mantis shrimp have been known to crack the glass of their tanks.</p>
